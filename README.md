# Simple-UEFI-Bootloader
A UEFI bootloader for bare-metal x86-64 applications. It's llke a much simpler version of GRUB meant for writing your own operating system-less 64-bit programs. Supports Windows, Linux, and Mac executable binaries (PE32+, 64-bit ELF, and 64-bit Mach-O).

**Coming Soon**  

Current status: It works, but it's a 1000+ line "main" function and needs to be cleaned up before I upload it.
  
A simple bare-metal kernel using this bootloader will be uploaded here:

Why not upload it as-is?  
Consider the fact that, once something is released online, it can very rapidly disseminate all over the place. If that ever were to happen here, it would be a shame if the most widely available version were an ugly mess.
