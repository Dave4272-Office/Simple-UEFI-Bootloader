# Simple-UEFI-Bootloader
A UEFI bootloader for bare-metal x86-64 applications

**Coming Soon**

Current status: It works, but it's a 1000+ line "main" function and needs to be cleaned up before I upload it.

A simple bare-metal kernel using this bootloader will be uploaded here:

Why not upload it as-is?
Consider the fact that, once something is released online, there is a nonzero chance someone will come across V1.0 and never update. Therefore V1.0 should be as release-ready as possible to facilitate usage.
